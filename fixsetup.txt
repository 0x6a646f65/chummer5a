Porpose of this branch is to create a class and all required support to replace the current character creation selection process. 
Among those goals is the abstraction of the data layer for this part, to make a possible switch to a database possible in the future.

The design is intended to be so that during character setup, the player creates an CharacterSetupInfo object that is given to the character during construction. 
It should then later be possible to change the CharacterSetupInfo with another to change everything about the character. Within limits.

The way this is archived is that the CharacterSetupInfo will present the options the character selects during setup. This will then be turned into a list of tasks that needs to be done before the character is ready to play.

This will then be compared with the list of tasks that the character already contains, and only the difference will be executed or removed.

For older characters this might or might not lead to easy converting, but it should give a really powerfull system allowing easy seamless changing of priorities and if wished, between priority based to karma based

Another goal of this is the integration of real, working, unit testing.
