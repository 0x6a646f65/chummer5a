Considder stetching a bit UI. Autoscale. UI elements have fixed size in width. We might want to try and scale with chummer width. OnResizeXXX event. 

Loading of legacy not loading specs. Everything else seems to work. Might give errors with non english exotic weapons (Or my problem might be localized, but check exotic melee)

Translate for all but skill level buttons

UI is missing stuff. Labels and old tooltips. Skillgroups should be straight forward, nfi about how skills currently works, but salvaging is probably best bet.

Skillgroups are not saving

Undo expense mostly working. (skills working (history not, needfix? i guess), skillgroups not working, dunremember baut specs)

Improvement.ImprovementType.SwapSkillAttribute is ignored. Not sure it is ever created without user doing it manually, but it is a thing and we (probably) have to support it. Also kinda usefull.

Not possible to spend skill points on knoskill (Stupid but explictily allowed)

Skillsofts is not tested, not check not called

Knoskills LM not working

Remove old skill forms. Keept as shitloads of code calls it, eventually that code have to be stripped out too.

Clean frmCreate/Career to not have old skillcode.
