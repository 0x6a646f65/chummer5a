Career mode not working compleetly. (Buttons is not hooked up to anything, UI is looking a little streched. A few writes to .X if Career mode in Controls?)

Autoscale. UI elements have fixed size in width. We might want to try and scale with chummer width. OnResizeXXX event. 

Had a crash when incrementing karma? (Ork, Karma Agi first place) Have not been able to reproduce later so assume fixed. Leaving it here because.

Specs localization not implemented. A dictionary of things it knows how to translate and reverse on load might be all it needs

Knoskill localization not implemented. Same as Specs

Loading of legacy not loading specs. Everything else seems to work. Might give errors with non english exotic weapons (Or my problem might be localized, but check exotic melee)

Don't think translate is called. Somehow visual studio crashed if i had it earlier. Not able to reproduce.

UI is missing stuff. Labels and old tooltips. Skillgroups should be straight forward, nfi about how skills currently works, but salvaging is probably best bet.

Artisian

Undo expense not working


Remove old skill forms. Keept as shitloads of code calls it, eventually that code have to be stripped out too.

Clean frmCreate/Career to not have old skillcode.

Not possible to spend skill points on knoskill (Stupid but explictily allowed)

Skillsofts is not working...

Knoskills LM not working
