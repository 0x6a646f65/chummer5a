Considder stetching a bit UI. Autoscale. UI elements have fixed size in width. We might want to try and scale with chummer width. OnResizeXXX event. 

Loading of legacy not loading specs. Everything else seems to work. Might give errors with non english exotic weapons (Or my problem might be localized, but check exotic melee)  (think this works)

Undo expense mostly working. (skills working (history not, needfix? i guess), skillgroups not working, dunremember baut specs)

Improvement.ImprovementType.SwapSkillAttribute is ignored. Not sure it is ever created without user doing it manually, but it is a thing and we (probably) have to support it. Also kinda usefull.

Knoskills LM not working

Skill grouping button in options

Events need unsubscribe or memory leak (wth cares?) (i think)
