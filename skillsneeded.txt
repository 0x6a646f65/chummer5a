Known limitations
	Loading of legacy not loading specs. Everything else seems to work. Might give errors with non english exotic weapons (Or my problem might be localized, but check exotic melee)  (think this works)

	Undo expense mostly working. (skills working (history not, needfix? i guess), skillgroups not working, dunremember baut specs)

	Improvement.ImprovementType.SwapSkillAttribute is ignored. Not sure it is ever created without user doing it manually, but it is a thing and we (probably) have to support it. Also kinda usefull.

	Knoskills LM not working

	Events need unsubscribe or memory leak (wth cares?) (i think)

	Knowsofts don't require skilljack
	
	Cyberlimb Optimization is not included in cyberlimb pool tooltip
	
	Tooltip not updating with cyberarms
	Updating gear don't trigger skill rating change and requires either a reload of character or manually changing skill rating and back
		
	Not removing old untakable skills
	
	Skillgroups not quite updating right (DisplayRating)
	
	Custom display attributes needs reset button
	
	Exotic Skills is goofed
